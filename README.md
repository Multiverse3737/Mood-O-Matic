### Project Description
[Our fun project uses webcam-based facial expression detection to identify a person's facial expressions and instantly displaying a matching emoji on screen. It’s a lighthearted blend of computer vision and humor, proving technology can be both clever and playful.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[In today’s fast-paced digital world, many people experience stress, sadness, anger, and even early signs of depression due to work pressure, isolation, and constant screen time. These negative emotions often go unnoticed in virtual environments, leading to reduced productivity, poor communication, and declining mental well-being. There is a need for a light, engaging way to recognize emotions and uplift moods in real time.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[Our project lightens the mood by instantly turning facial expressions into playful emojis, bringing humor and positivity to the moment. It helps reduce tension through instant, funny visual feedback, creating enjoyable moments whether during work, study, or casual chats. By encouraging smiles and fostering positive interactions, it transforms ordinary screen time into a more joyful and stress-free experience.It can also be adapted for mood tracking, stress detection, or adding playful elements to apps and games.]
